# Privacy & Cookies

_Last updated: 2025-12-31_

This page explains how **Bakker Technologies** processes personal data when you visit this website.

## Who we are (controller)

**Controller:** Bakker Technologies  
**Contact:** [support@bakkertechnologies.no](mailto:support@bakkertechnologies.no)

## What we collect

### Strictly necessary storage

We store your **cookie/analytics preference** in your browser (local storage). This is strictly necessary to remember your choice.

### Analytics (optional)

If you **opt in**, we use **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** to understand traffic and improve the site (e.g. which pages are visited, approximate location, device/browser information).

In the **EU/EEA**, analytics are **off by default** and only enabled after you consent.

## Legal basis

- **Analytics**: your **consent** (GDPR Art. 6(1)(a)).  
- **Preference storage** (remembering your choice): **legitimate interests / necessity** to provide the preference function.

## International transfers

Google may process data outside the EU/EEA (including the United States). Where applicable, transfers rely on legal mechanisms such as **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** and/or other safeguards provided by Google.

## How to change or withdraw consent

You can change your choice anytime:

- Use the **“Cookie settings”** link in the footer, or
- Clear this site’s storage in your browser.

If your browser has **Do Not Track** enabled, we also avoid loading analytics.

## Data retention

Analytics data retention settings are controlled in Google Analytics. We aim to keep retention as short as practical for site improvement.

## Your rights

If GDPR applies to you, you may have rights including access, deletion, restriction, objection, and data portability. Contact us at the email above.
